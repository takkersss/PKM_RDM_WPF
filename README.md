## CODE

I created this app from scratch to learn WPF and JSON serialization, but above all for fun. I focused on implementing functionalities.
So I did not include good programming practices, such as MVVM. Code is HUGELY upgradable.
There isn't a lot of comments but I chose to set it open source in order to make it more useful.

I use https://pokeapi.co/ to retrieve Pokémon datas but there's many APIs that make it easier, such as https://github.com/jtwotimes/PokeApiNet for .NET C#.
